## Technologies used

- [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/): A fullstack template for TypeScript projects with Next.js, Prisma, and tRPC

  - [Next.js](https://nextjs.org)
  - [NextAuth.js](https://next-auth.js.org)
  - [Prisma](https://prisma.io)
  - [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com)
  - [tRPC](https://trpc.io)

- [AWS api gateway](https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/): API Gateway is a fully managed service that makes it easy for developers to create, publish, maintain, monitor, and secure APIs at any scale.

- [Ngrok](https://ngrok.com/docs/getting-started/?os=windows): Expose a local web server to the internet, useful for debugging.

- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/): Used for deployment.

- [Coackroackdb](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/): Used to host the database.

## Considerations of current deployment

- For demonstration purposes, admin routes can be accesed without authentication, however, some functionality may be unable to be used without authentication, such as modifying data and querying all users' data.
- The database may be erased after some time, since it is hosted in a free tier.
